        Florida is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States,
        bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico; Alabama to the northwest;
        Georgia to the north; the Bahamas and Atlantic Ocean to the east; and
        the Straits of Florida and Cuba to the south. It is the only state that
        borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. With a
        population exceeding 21 million, it is the third-most populous state in
        the nation and ranks 8th in population density as of 2020. It spans
        65,758 square miles (170,310 km2), ranking 22nd in area among the 50
        states. The Miami metropolitan area, anchored by the cities of Miami,
        Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, is the state's largest
        metropolitan area with a population of 6.138 million, and the state's
        most-populous city is Jacksonville with a population of 949,611.
        Florida's other major population centers include Tampa Bay, Orlando,
        Cape Coral, and the state capital of Tallahassee.

      Various Native American groups have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000
      years. In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León became the first known
      European to make landfall, calling the region La Florida ([la floˈɾiða]
      for its lush greenery and the Easter season (Pascua Florida in Spanish).
      Florida subsequently became the first area in the continental U.S. to be
      permanently settled by Europeans, with the Spanish colony of St.
      Augustine, founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city.
      Florida was repeatedly contested by Spain and Great Britain before being
      ceded to the U.S. in 1819; it was admitted as the 27th state on March 3,
      1845. Florida was the principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858),
      the longest and most extensive of the Indian Wars in U.S. history. The
      state seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the
      seven original Confederate States, and was readmitted to the Union after
      the Civil War on June 25, 1868. Since the mid-20th century, Florida has
      experienced rapid demographic and economic growth. Its economy, with a
      gross state product (GSP) of $1.4 trillion, is the fourth-largest of any
      U.S. state and the 16th-largest in the world; the main sectors are
      tourism, hospitality, agriculture, real estate, and transportation.
      Florida is world-renowned for its beach resorts, amusement parks, warm and
      sunny climate, and nautical recreation; attractions such as Walt Disney
      World, the Kennedy Space Center, and Miami Beach draw tens of millions of
      visitors annually. Florida is a popular destination for retirees, seasonal
      vacationers, and both domestic and international migrants; it hosts nine
      out of the ten fastest-growing communities in the U.S. The state's close
      proximity to the ocean has shaped its culture, identity, and daily life;
      its colonial history and successive waves of migration are reflected in
      African, European, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian influences. Florida has
      attracted or inspired some of the most prominent American writers,
      including Ernest Hemingway, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, and Tennessee
      Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes, particularly
      in golf, tennis, auto racing, and water sports. Florida has been
      considered a battleground state in American presidential elections,
      particularly those in 2000, 2016, and 2020. About two-thirds of Florida
      occupies a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. It
      has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, spanning
      approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km), not including its many barrier
      islands. Florida has 4,510 islands that are ten acres (4.0 hectares) or
      larger in area, the second-largest of any state after Alaska. Much of
      Florida is at or near sea level, and is characterized by sedimentary soil.
      Florida is the flattest state in the country, with the lowest high point
      of any U.S. state, at just 345 feet (105 meters). Florida's largest
      freshwater lake, Lake Okeechobee, is the second-largest located entirely
      within the contiguous 48 states and often referred to as an inland sea.
      Several beaches in Florida have turquoise and emerald-colored coastal
      waters. Florida's climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical
      in the south. It is the only state besides Hawaii to have a tropical
      climate, and is the only continental state with both a tropical climate,
      located at the southern portion of the state, and a coral reef. Florida
      has several unique ecosystems, including Everglades National Park, the
      largest tropical wilderness in the U.S. and among the largest in the
      Americas. Unique wildlife include the American alligator, American
      crocodile, American flamingo, Roseate spoonbill, Florida panther,
      bottlenose dolphin, and manatee. The Florida Reef is the only living coral
      barrier reef in the continental United States, and the third-largest coral
      barrier reef system in the world after the Great Barrier Reef, and Belize
      Barrier Reef.

        Indiana (/ˌɪndiˈænə/ (listen)) is a U.S. state in the Midwestern United
        States. It is the 38th-largest by area and the 17th-most populous of the
        50 States. Its capital and largest city is Indianapolis. Indiana was
        admitted to the United States as the 19th state on December 11, 1816. It
        is bordered by Lake Michigan to the northwest, Michigan to the north and
        northeast, Ohio to the east, the Ohio River and Kentucky to the south
        and southeast, and the Wabash River and Illinois to the west. Various
        indigenous peoples inhabited what would become Indiana for thousands of
        years, some of whom the U.S. government expelled between 1800 and 1836.
        Indiana received its name because the state was largely possessed by
        native tribes even after it was granted statehood. Since then,
        settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural
        segmentation present in the Eastern United States; the state's
        northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and
        New York, Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and
        adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Upland South,
        particularly Kentucky and Tennessee.[15] Indiana has a diverse economy
        with a gross state product of $352.62 billion in 2021.[16] It has
        several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a
        number of smaller cities and towns. Indiana is home to professional
        sports teams, including the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and the NBA's
        Indiana Pacers. The state also hosts several notable competitive events,
        such as the Indianapolis 500, held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

      Etymology Welcome to Indiana, Crossroads of America.jpg Indiana's name
      means "Land of the Indians", or simply "Indian Land".[b] It also stems
      from Indiana's territorial history. On May 7, 1800, the United States
      Congress passed legislation to divide the Northwest Territory into two
      areas and named the western section the Indiana Territory. In 1816, when
      Congress passed an Enabling Act to begin the process of establishing
      statehood for Indiana, a part of this territorial land became the
      geographic area for the new state.[c][17][18] Formal use of the word
      Indiana dates from 1768, when a Philadelphia-based trading company gave
      its land claim in present-day West Virginia the name "Indiana" in honor of
      its previous owners, the Iroquois. Later, ownership of the claim was
      transferred to the Indiana Land Company, the first recorded use of the
      word Indiana. But the Virginia colony argued that it was the rightful
      owner of the land because it fell within its geographic boundaries. The
      U.S. Supreme Court denied the land company's right to the claim in
      1798.[19] Hoosier A native or resident of Indiana is known as a
      Hoosier.[20] The etymology of this word is disputed, but the leading
      theory, advanced by the Indiana Historical Bureau and the Indiana
      Historical Society, has its origin in Virginia, the Carolinas, and
      Tennessee (the Upland South) as a term for a backwoodsman, a rough
      countryman, or a country bumpkin.[21][22] History Main article: History of
      Indiana See also: Outline of Indiana § History Indigenous inhabitants
      Angel Mounds State Historic Site was one of the northernmost Mississippian
      culture settlements, occupied from 1100 to 1450. The first inhabitants in
      what is now Indiana were the Paleo-Indians, who arrived about 8000 BC
      after the melting of the glaciers at the end of the Ice Age. Divided into
      small groups, the Paleo-Indians were nomads who hunted large game such as
      mastodons. They created stone tools made out of chert by chipping,
      knapping and flaking.[23] The Archaic period, which began between 5000 and
      4000 BC, covered the next phase of indigenous culture. The people
      developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step
      in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points
      and knives, with various forms of notches. They made ground-stone tools
      such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the
      latter part of the period, they built earthwork mounds and middens, which
      showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended
      at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.[23] The
      Woodland period began around 1500 BC when new cultural attributes
      appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery and extended their
      cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the Adena
      people had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth
      mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the Hopewell people began to
      develop long-range trade of goods. Nearing the end of the stage, the
      people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of
      agriculture, growing such crops as corn and squash. The Woodland period
      ended around 1000 AD.[23] The Mississippian culture emerged, lasting from
      1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans.
      During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed
      according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining
      ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the
      agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the Angel Mounds. They had
      large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived
      or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana
      during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.[23] The
      historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European
      encounter spoke different languages of the Algonquian family. They
      included the Shawnee, Miami, and Illini. Refugee tribes from eastern
      regions, including the Delaware who settled in the White and Whitewater
      River Valleys, later joined them. European exploration and sovereignty See
      also: New France, Louisiana (New France), Illinois Country, and Province
      of Quebec (1763–1791) Native Americans guide French explorers through
      Indiana, as depicted by Maurice Thompson in Stories of Indiana. In 1679,
      French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle was the first
      European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day South Bend at
      the St. Joseph River.[24] He returned the following year to learn about
      the region. French-Canadian fur traders soon arrived, bringing blankets,
      jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native
      Americans. By 1702, Sieur Juchereau established the first trading post
      near Vincennes. In 1715, Sieur de Vincennes built Fort Miami at Kekionga,
      now Fort Wayne. In 1717, another Canadian, Picote de Beletre, built Fort
      Ouiatenon on the Wabash River, to try to control Native American trade
      routes from Lake Erie to the Mississippi River. In 1732, Sieur de
      Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian
      settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned
      in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived
      from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the
      lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists
      occurred throughout the 1750s as a result. The Native American tribes of
      Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the French and Indian War
      (also known as the Seven Years' War). With British victory in 1763, the
      French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North
      America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the colonies.
      The tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured Fort Ouiatenon and
      Fort Miami during Pontiac's Rebellion. The British royal proclamation of
      1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Native American use,
      and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called
      "Indian Territory". In 1775, the American Revolutionary War began as the
      colonists sought self-government and independence from the British. The
      majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot
      military officer George Rogers Clark called for an army to help fight the
      British in the west.[25] Clark's army won significant battles and took
      over Vincennes and Fort Sackville on February 25, 1779.[26] During the
      war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the
      eastern colonists from the west. His success is often credited for
      changing the course of the American Revolutionary War.[27] At the end of
      the war, through the Treaty of Paris, the British crown ceded their claims
      to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States,
      including Native American lands.

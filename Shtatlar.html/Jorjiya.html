        Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, romanized: sakartvelo, IPA:
        [sɑkʰɑrtʰvɛlɔ] (listen)) is a transcontinental country at the
        intersection of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is part of the
        Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to the west, Russia to the
        north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and
        by Azerbaijan to the southeast. The country covers an area of 69,700
        square kilometres (26,900 sq mi), and has a population of 3.7 million
        people.[b][10] Tbilisi is its capital and largest city, home to roughly
        a third of the Georgian population.

      During the classical era, several independent kingdoms became established
      in what is now Georgia, such as Colchis and Iberia. In the early 4th
      century, ethnic Georgians officially adopted Christianity, which
      contributed to the spiritual and political unification of the early
      Georgian states. In the Middle Ages, the unified Kingdom of Georgia
      emerged and reached its Golden Age during the reign of King David IV and
      Queen Tamar in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Thereafter, the kingdom
      declined and eventually disintegrated under the hegemony of various
      regional powers, including the Mongols, the Turks, and various dynasties
      of Persia. In 1783, one of the Georgian kingdoms entered into an alliance
      with the Russian Empire, which proceeded to annex the territory of modern
      Georgia in a piecemeal fashion throughout the 19th century. After the
      Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia emerged as an independent republic
      under German protection.[11] Following World War I, Georgia was invaded
      and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1922, becoming one of its constituent
      republics. In the 1980s, an independence movement emerged and grew
      quickly, leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union in April
      1991. For most of the subsequent decade, post-Soviet Georgia suffered from
      economic crisis, political instability, ethnic conflict, and secessionist
      wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following the bloodless Rose
      Revolution in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy;
      it introduced a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at
      integration into the European Union and NATO. The country's Western
      orientation soon led to worsening relations with Russia, which culminated
      in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008, and entrenched Russian occupation of a
      portion of Georgia. Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a
      unitary parliamentary republic.[12][13] It is a developing country with a
      very high Human Development Index. Economic reforms since independence
      have led to higher levels of economic freedom, as well as reductions in
      corruption indicators, poverty, and unemployment. It was one of the first
      countries in the world to legalize cannabis, becoming the only
      former-socialist state to do so. The country is a member of international
      organizations, such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, Eurocontrol, the
      EBRD, the BSEC, the GUAM, the ADB, the WTO, and the Energy Community.The
      first mention of the name spelled as Georgia is in Italian on the mappa
      mundi of Pietro Vesconte dated AD 1320.[14] At the early stage of its
      appearance in the Latin world, it was not always written in the same
      transliteration, and the first consonant was being spelt with J as
      Jorgia.[15] Georgia probably stems from the Persian designation of the
      Georgians – gurğān, in the 11th and 12th centuries adapted via Syriac
      gurz-ān/gurz-iyān and Arabic ĵurĵan/ĵurzan. Lore-based theories were given
      by the traveller Jacques de Vitry, who explained the name's origin by the
      popularity of St. George amongst Georgians,[16] while traveller Jean
      Chardin thought that Georgia came from Greek γεωργός ('tiller of the
      land'). Alexander Mikaberidze wrote that these century-old explanations
      for the word Georgia/Georgians are rejected by the scholarly community,
      who point to the Persian word gurğ/gurğān (گرگ, 'wolf'[17]) as the root of
      the word.[18] Starting with the Persian word gurğ/gurğān, the word was
      later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West
      European languages.[18][19] This term itself might have been established
      through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-Caspian region, which
      was referred to as Gorgan ("land of the wolves").[18][20] The native name
      is Sakartvelo (საქართველო; 'land of Kartvelians'), derived from the core
      central Georgian region of Kartli, recorded from the 9th century, and in
      extended usage referring to the entire medieval Kingdom of Georgia by the
      13th century. The self-designation used by ethnic Georgians is Kartvelebi
      (ქართველები, i.e. 'Kartvelians'), first attested in the Umm Leisun
      inscription found in the Old City of Jerusalem. The medieval Georgian
      Chronicles present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians, Kartlos, a
      great-grandson of Japheth. However, scholars agree that the word is
      derived from the Karts, one of the proto-Georgian tribes that emerged as a
      dominant group in ancient times.[18] The name Sakartvelo (საქართველო)
      consists of two parts. Its root, kartvel-i (ქართველ-ი), specifies an
      inhabitant of the core central-eastern Georgian region of Kartli, or
      Iberia as it is known in sources of the Eastern Roman Empire.[21] Ancient
      Greeks (Strabo, Herodotus, Plutarch, Homer, etc.) and Romans (Titus
      Livius, Tacitus, etc.) referred to early western Georgians as Colchians
      and eastern Georgians as Iberians (Iberoi, Ἰβηροι in some Greek
      sources).[22] The Georgian circumfix sa-X-o is a standard geographic
      construction designating 'the area where X dwell', where X is an
      ethnonym.[23] Today, the official name of the country is Georgia, as
      specified in the English version of the Georgian constitution which reads
      "Georgia is the name of the state of Georgia."[24] The Georgian language
      version of the constitution refers to the legal name of country as
      Georgian: „საქართველო“ Sakartvelo.[25] Before the 1995 constitution came
      into force, the country's official name was the Republic of Georgia
      (Georgian: საქართველოს რესპუბლიკა, romanized: Sakartvelos Resp'ublik'a)
      and it is still sometimes referred to by that name.[26][27]

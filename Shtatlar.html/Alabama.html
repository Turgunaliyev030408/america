      Alabama (/ˌæləˈbæmə/) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United
      States, bordered by Tennessee to the north; Georgia to the east; Florida
      and the Gulf of Mexico to the south; and Mississippi to the west. Alabama
      is the 30th largest by area[9] and the 24th-most populous of the U.S.
      states.[10] Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state
      bird. Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie" and the "Cotton
      State". The state tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the
      camellia. Alabama's capital is Montgomery, and its largest city by
      population and area is Huntsville.[11] Its oldest city is Mobile, founded
      by French colonists (Alabama Creoles) in 1702 as the capital of French
      Louisiana.[12][13] Greater Birmingham is Alabama's largest metropolitan
      area and its economic center.[14] Originally home to many native tribes,
      present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth
      century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The
      British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the American
      Revolutionary War. Spain held Mobile as part of Spanish West Florida until
      1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the
      antebellum period, Alabama was a major producer of cotton, and widely used
      African American slave labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United
      States to become part of the Confederate States of America, with
      Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868.
      Following the American Civil War, Alabama would suffer decades of economic
      hardship, in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main
      driver of the state's economy. Similar to other former slave states,
      Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws from the late 19th century up
      until the 1960s. High-profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery march
      made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the
      1950s and 1960s. During and after World War II, Alabama grew as the
      state's economy diversified with new industries. NASA's Marshall Space
      Flight Center in Huntsville would help Alabama's economic growth in the
      mid-to-late 20th century, by developing an aerospace industry. Alabama's
      economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism,
      manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education,
      retail, and technology.[15] The state's geography is diverse, with the
      north dominated by the mountainous Tennessee Valley and the south by
      Mobile Bay, a historically significant port. Politically, as part of the
      Deep South, Alabama is predominantly a conservative state, and is known
      for its Southern culture. Within Alabama, American football, particularly
      at the college level, plays a major part of the state's culture.

      Etymology The European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was
      derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members
      lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the
      upper reaches of the river.[16] In the Alabama language, the word for a
      person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Albàamo in
      different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha).[17] The word's spelling
      varies significantly among historical sources.[18] The first usage appears
      in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de
      la Vega used Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote
      Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in transliterations of the term.[18] As
      early as 1702, the French called the tribe the Alibamon, with French maps
      identifying the river as Rivière des Alibamons.[16] Other spellings of the
      name have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou,
      Alabamu, Allibamou.[18][19][20] and possibly Alabahmu.[citation needed]
      The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in
      the U.S.; an estimated 26 states have names of Native American origin.[21]
      Sources disagree on the word's meaning. Some scholars suggest the word
      comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning 'plants' or 'weeds') and amo (meaning
      'to cut', 'to trim', or 'to gather').[18][22][23] The meaning may have
      been 'clearers of the thicket'[22] or 'herb gatherers',[23][24] referring
      to clearing land for cultivation[19] or collecting medicinal plants.[24]
      The state has numerous place names of Native American origin.[25][26]
      However, there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama
      language. An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed it meant
      'Here We Rest'.[18] This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the
      writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek.[18] Experts in the Muskogean
      languages have not found any evidence to support such a
      translation.[16][18]

      "The flag of the State of Alabama shall be a crimson cross of St. Andrew
      on a field of white. The bars forming the cross shall be not less than six
      inches broad, and must extend diagonally across the flag from side to
      side." – (Code 1896, §3751; Code 1907, §2058; Code 1923, §2995; Code 1940,
      T. 55, §5.) The cross of St. Andrew referred to in the law is a diagonal
      cross, known in vexillology as a saltire. Because the bars must be at
      least six inches (150 mm) wide, small representations of the Alabama flag
      do not meet the legal definition. In 2001, a survey conducted by the North
      American Vexillological Association ranked Alabama's state flag 29th in
      design quality of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S.
      territorial flags.[3] There are sources that believe the saltire was
      intended to memorialize the Confederacy, but no legislative records
      indicate the inspiration for the flag.

      1861 flag On January 11, 1861, the Alabama Secession Convention passed a
      resolution designating an official flag. Designed by several women from
      Montgomery, final touches were made by Francis Corra of that city.[4] One
      side of the flag displayed the goddess of Liberty holding an unsheathed
      sword in her right hand; in her left, she held a small blue flag with one
      gold star. Above the gold star appears the text "Alabama" in all capital
      letters. In an arch above this figure were the words "Independent Now and
      Forever".[5] The reverse side of the flag had a cotton plant with a coiled
      rattlesnake. The text "Noli Me Tangere", ("Touch Me Not" in Latin), was
      placed below the cotton plant. This flag was flown until February 10,
      1861, when it was removed to the governor's office after it was damaged by
      severe weather. It was never flown again.[5]
